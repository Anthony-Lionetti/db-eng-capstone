# Description

This repo was made to house my work for the Database Engineering Capstone for the Meta Coursera specialization course. I wanted to go a bit deeper than what was outlined in the course, so this is not exactly what the course suggest, but it is very close. The major differences is that I provide my Database initialization in a Jupiter Notebook using `mysql-connector-python` to write the majority of the database code.

# Peer Review Grading Help

- The Jupiter notebook is already prerun with outputs in the [jupiter notebook](testing.ipynb)
  - NOTE: I used the `mysql-connector-python` to run all of the queries instead of writing them in SQL
- My dashboard with the relevant data analysis is available [here]()

## Building the Database and its Functions

The majority of the work with writing and executing the queries is in the testing.ipynb.

## Data Visualizations in Streamlit (instead of Tableau)

In this project, I chose to use streamlit, an up and coming python library that is used to rapidly develope python web apps. The motive for this switch is multifaceted, but primarily because I used Tableau extensively in a previous role and I no longer have access to a desktop license.
